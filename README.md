# Portfolio

This portfolio documents my current, and past projects. As a Music student and Engineer, many of my projects exist either in the audio-electronics field, or are related to computer architecture.

## Current Projects
### Spectre Attack
This is a generic Spectre Attack, heavily based on the attack from Seed Labs (https://seedsecuritylabs.org). 
However, the aforementioned attack relies heavily on x86 intrinsic instructions, such as clflush, and rdtscp. To avoid this dependence, my Spectre attack project uses a pthread timer, and a generic cache-evict method.
