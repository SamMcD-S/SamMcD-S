# Portfolio

This portfolio documents my current, and past projects. As a Music student and Engineer, many of my projects exist either in the audio-electronics field, or are related to computer architecture.

## Current Projects
### Spectre Attack
This is a generic Spectre Attack, heavily based on the attack from Seed Labs (https://seedsecuritylabs.org). 
However, the aforementioned attack relies heavily on x86 intrinsic instructions, such as clflush, and rdtscp. To avoid this dependence, my Spectre attack project uses a pthread timer, and a generic cache-evict method.
### Voltage Glitch Attack
In this project, I built open-source modules to run a voltage glitch on the Basys 3 FPGA development board. Demonstrations are also documented here.
### Bluetooth Page Turning Pedal
As a musician who reads music from an Ipad, a bluetooth page-turning pedal is a important tool to overcome awkward (or just fast) page turns. Despite their internal simplicity, bluetooth page-turning pedals are surprisingly expensive, often costing between 75 and 100$. In this project, I design a simple and inexpensive alternative.
## Current Research
### Spectre Attack Mitigation
Over the past year, I have worked in the Computer Architecture Lab at CU Boulder on a more-efficient defense against the Spectre Attack. I will update this section of the portfolio at a later time.
Key skills and tools I have used during this research:
  - I have modified the GCC Compiler, adding a new instruction.
  - I have used the gem5 Processor Simulator
### Audio Electronics
What makes "Audiophile" gear so expensive? How can I better interpret the specifications of the gear I use to understand effects on my listening experience. 

Throughout this project, I'll build measurement tools to aid a quantitative analisys of the devices I test. I firmly believe that if a difference can't be measured, it can't be heard!
